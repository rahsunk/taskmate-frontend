# TaskMate Frontend - Generate Schedule Feature

## âœ… **Generate Schedule Feature Complete!**

I've successfully implemented a comprehensive schedule generation system with a greedy scheduling algorithm that creates a visual schedule based on events and tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ **What's Been Implemented**

### **Core Components**

- **GeneratedScheduleView.vue** - Visual schedule display with day/hour grid
- **Enhanced ScheduleManager.vue** - Added view switching and generate button
- **Enhanced scheduleStore.js** - Added greedy scheduling algorithm

### **Key Features**

âœ… **Greedy Scheduling Algorithm** - Follows all specified rules
âœ… **Visual Schedule Grid** - Day/hour layout with color-coded items
âœ… **Conflict Resolution** - No overlapping events and tasks
âœ… **Event Preservation** - Keeps original event times and dates
âœ… **Task Prioritization** - Earlier deadlines scheduled first
âœ… **Active Hours** - Tasks scheduled between 9AM-6PM only
âœ… **Duration Respect** - Task blocks match expected completion time
âœ… **Repeating Events** - Handles daily, weekly, monthly repeats

## ðŸš€ **Scheduling Algorithm Rules**

The greedy scheduler follows these rules exactly as requested:

1. **No Overlaps** - Events and tasks never conflict with each other
2. **Event Preservation** - Event times and dates remain unchanged
3. **Deadline Priority** - Tasks with earlier deadlines scheduled first
4. **Active Hours** - All tasks scheduled between 9AM to 6PM
5. **Duration Matching** - Task block length equals expected completion time

## ðŸ“± **User Experience Flow**

1. **Add Events & Tasks** - User creates events and tasks in the manage view
2. **Generate Schedule** - User clicks "ðŸŽ¯ Generate Schedule" button
3. **View Schedule** - Automatically switches to schedule view showing the generated plan
4. **Visual Grid** - Schedule displayed as day/hour grid with color-coded items
5. **Interactive Elements** - Hover for details, visual indicators for overdue items

## ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Features**

### **Schedule Grid**

- **Time Column** - Shows hours from 9AM to 6PM
- **Day Columns** - Shows each day with events and tasks
- **Color Coding** - Blue for events, green for tasks, red for overdue
- **Current Hour** - Highlights current time slot
- **Today Highlight** - Emphasizes today's column

### **Item Display**

- **Event Items** - Show name, time range, repeat info
- **Task Items** - Show name, time range, priority level
- **Overdue Indicators** - Red highlighting for overdue tasks
- **Tooltips** - Detailed information on hover
- **Responsive Design** - Adapts to different screen sizes

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Scheduling Algorithm**

```javascript
// 1. Process events first (fixed times)
// 2. Handle repeating events (daily, weekly, monthly)
// 3. Sort tasks by deadline, then priority
// 4. Find available slots in 15-minute intervals
// 5. Schedule tasks within active hours (9AM-6PM)
// 6. Avoid conflicts with existing items
```

### **Conflict Detection**

- **Overlap Detection** - Checks if time ranges intersect
- **Slot Finding** - Searches for available 15-minute intervals
- **Boundary Checking** - Ensures tasks fit within active hours

### **Repeating Events**

- **Daily** - Generates occurrences for next 7 days
- **Weekly** - Respects selected days of week
- **Monthly** - Shows original event (simplified)

## ðŸ§ª **Testing the Feature**

1. **Visit** `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Add Events** - Create some events with different times
4. **Add Tasks** - Create tasks with deadlines and priorities
5. **Generate Schedule** - Click "ðŸŽ¯ Generate Schedule" button
6. **View Results** - See the visual schedule grid
7. **Test Scenarios**:
   - Add overlapping events (should be preserved)
   - Add tasks with tight deadlines (should be prioritized)
   - Add tasks outside 9AM-6PM (should be rescheduled)
   - Add repeating events (should show multiple occurrences)

## ðŸ“Š **Schedule Visualization**

The generated schedule shows:

- **Time Slots** - Each hour from 9AM to 6PM
- **Event Blocks** - Blue rectangles showing event duration
- **Task Blocks** - Green rectangles showing task duration
- **Overdue Tasks** - Red highlighting for missed deadlines
- **Priority Indicators** - Visual cues for task importance
- **Duration Accuracy** - Block height matches expected time

## ðŸŽ¯ **Algorithm Efficiency**

The greedy scheduler:

- **Processes events first** (O(n) where n = number of events)
- **Sorts tasks by deadline** (O(m log m) where m = number of tasks)
- **Finds slots efficiently** (O(k) where k = number of 15-min intervals)
- **Avoids conflicts** (O(n+m) conflict checking per task)
- **Overall complexity** - O(n + m log m + mk) - very efficient for typical use cases

The implementation provides a solid foundation for schedule generation and can be easily extended with more sophisticated algorithms or additional constraints!
