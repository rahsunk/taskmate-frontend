- **concept** UserAuthentication[User]
- **purpose** limit access to known users and find users by name
- **principle** After a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated each time as the same user. They can also be looked up by other users when sharing events
- **state**
  - a set of `Users` with
    - a `username` of type `String`
    - a `password` of type `String`
- **actions**
  - `register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    - **requires**: no `User` with `username` exists
    - **effects**: create and return a new `User` with the given `username` and `password`
  - `authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    - **requires**: `User` with the same `username` and `password` exists
    - **effects**: grants access to the `User` associated with that `username` and `password`
    * `changePassword (user: User, oldPassword: String, newPassword: String)`
      - **requires**: `user` exists and `user.password` is equal to `oldPassword`
      - **effects**: `password` for `user` is changed to `newPassword`.
    * `deleteAccount (user: User)`
      - **requires**: `user` exists
      - **effects**: `user` is removed from the state
