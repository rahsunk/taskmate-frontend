|Component|Description (what good work looks like)|Common Failures (examples of falling short)|
|---|---|---|
|**Functionality**|The frontend supports all functionality described by the operational principles and actions of the concept designs; the app is fully reactive and requires no page refreshes.|Some actions or parts are missing; the app only partially reflects operational principles; occasional or frequent page refreshes are required; reactivity is inconsistent.|
|**Robustness**|Where appropriate, client‑side validation and error checking are performed; informative error messages are shown.|Validation is present but misses opportunities to catch errors; several areas lack client‑side validation; error messages are missing, opaque, or unhelpful.|
|**Usability**|Visual and interaction design help users learn novel concepts, providing an efficient and intuitive flow through the app.|Usability frictions arise from visual or interaction design choices; minimal design makes the app difficult or frustrating to use.|
|**Visual Design Study**|The design study explores a diverse range of visual media; typographic and color inspiration are well‑extracted and communicated.|Inspiration is drawn from a narrow range of sources; the study is missing or incomplete (e.g., focuses only on color or only on typography); specific inspirations are not identified or are poorly communicated.|
|**Styling & Layout**|Layout and styling give the app an attractive, cohesive, and clearly draws on the visual design study.|Rough edges undermine cohesion or attractiveness; styling and layout are minimal and fail to provide a cohesive feel.|
