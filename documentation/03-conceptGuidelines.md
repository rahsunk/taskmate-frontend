**Reactive Components.** Implement your sketches and concepts as a series of individual Vue.js components. These components should cleanly separate concerns—each component should be responsible for managing its own state/data and other behavior. Note: there may not be an exact one-to-one correspondence between your concepts and Vue components as some components may combine data from multiple concepts, or vice versa. Components may be nested within one another, and will need to pass data back and forth accordingly (i.e., via props when passing data from a parent component to a child, or by emitting custom events to pass data vice-versa). You will likely also have some shared front-end state across components, using the browser’s native local storage or a Pinia store. The resultant user interface should be reactive: the web page should not need to be refreshed or reloaded to see the effect of the user’s action. For this task, we recommend focusing exclusively on the functionality of your components. Aesthetic concerns will come next.

**Testing your app and updating.** Make sure to test your front end repeatedly as you develop, ensuring that it works correctly with your back end. You are likely to find you will need to make changes both to the back end (for example, to add queries and actions) and to the front end. If you didn’t complete all your concept implementations, this is the time to do it! Document any significant changes to your back-end design.
