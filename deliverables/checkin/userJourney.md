# User Journey

You are an MIT student who is currently having trouble trying to come up with a schedule for the next couple of days. Doing this by yourself is time consuming and difficult so you decide to use Task-mate. After creating your account, you are taken to the home page, where you can start to input your events and tasks. First, you input the 1-hr Gym session you want to do on Oct 22 afternoon. Then, you input the 1-hr hangout session with your bestie on Oct 23 at around noon. After that, you input your tasks, which are your partially-completed math homework due by Friday night, and your internship application which you haven't started, due at Sunday night. After that, you click on Generate Schedule, where you see an automatically generated schedule of your events and tasks, ultimately helping you manage your activities for the next few days.
