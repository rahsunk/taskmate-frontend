# User Journey

You are an MIT student who is currently having trouble trying to come up with a schedule for the next couple of days. Doing this by yourself is time consuming and difficult so you decide to use Task-mate. After creating your account, you are taken to the home page, where you can start to input your events and tasks. First, you input the hours of school that you must attend on every weekday. Then, you input the 1-hr gym session you do every Saturday and Sunday night. Next, you input your tasks, which include your math pset (which you haven't started yet) that's due very soon, and your very urgent internship application (which you fortunately did a bit of), due slightly later. After that, you click on "Generate Schedule", where you see an automatically generated schedule of your events and tasks, helping you manage your activities for the next few days. For the math pset, you decide to try to ask your friend Tim about the possibility of working on it together at the given time. Tim already has a Task-mate account, so you navigate to the Friends page and send him a friend request. On Tim's side, they see the friend request and accept it. Then he sends a message to you asking when you guys should work on the pset. After Tim accepts your friend request, you see on your side that he is now your Task-mate friend and you can thus message him as well and open the chat history and respond back.
