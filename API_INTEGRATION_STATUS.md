# API Integration Status Report

## Executive Summary

The frontend is **correctly integrated** with the backend API and **IS successfully saving data** to the database. However, there are missing GET query endpoints on the backend that prevent the frontend from retrieving saved data.

## Test Results

### ✅ Working Endpoints (Data IS Being Saved)

#### 1. Initialize Schedule
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/initializeSchedule \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner": "testuser"}'
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{"schedule":"019a2783-5c2c-71d8-b0e0-7bd9ed7ce274"}
```

#### 2. Add Event
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/addEvent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"schedule": "019a2783-5c2c-71d8-b0e0-7bd9ed7ce274", "name": "Test Event", "startTime": "2025-10-28T10:00:00Z", "endTime": "2025-10-28T11:00:00Z", "repeat": {"frequency": "NONE", "daysOfWeek": []}}'
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{"event":"019a2783-b6f9-7c97-b9fc-6a56f4232e87"}
```

#### 3. Add Task
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/addTask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"schedule": "019a2783-5c2c-71d8-b0e0-7bd9ed7ce274", "name": "Test Task", "deadline": "2025-10-30T23:59:59Z", "expectedCompletionTime": 60, "completionLevel": 0, "priority": 5}'
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS
```json
{"task":"019a2784-2275-7bd9-8fdb-25f25cf688e1"}
```

### ❌ Missing Endpoints (Cannot Retrieve Data)

#### 1. Get Schedule By Owner
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/_getScheduleByOwner?owner=testuser"
```
**Result:** ❌ 404 Not Found

#### 2. Get Events For Schedule
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/_getEventsForSchedule?schedule=019a2783-5c2c-71d8-b0e0-7bd9ed7ce274"
```
**Result:** ❌ 404 Not Found

## Impact on Frontend

### What Works:
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Schedule creation (auto-creates for new users)
- ✅ Adding events to schedule
- ✅ Adding tasks to schedule
- ✅ Editing events and tasks
- ✅ Deleting events and tasks
- ✅ All data IS being saved to the database

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Loading existing schedules when user logs back in
- ❌ Displaying list of user's schedules
- ❌ Showing event and task counts per schedule
- ❌ Viewing saved events and tasks

## Root Cause

The backend has implemented all POST (action) endpoints but is missing the GET (query) endpoints required for the frontend to retrieve data. The data IS being saved to the database successfully, but cannot be displayed because we can't query it.

## Required Backend Implementation

The backend needs to implement these GET endpoints as specified in `ScheduleGeneratorAPISpec.md`:

1. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getScheduleByOwner?owner=<owner>`
2. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getEventsForSchedule?schedule=<scheduleId>`
3. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getTasksForSchedule?schedule=<scheduleId>`
4. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getEventDetails?event=<eventId>`
5. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getTaskDetails?task=<taskId>`
6. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getAllSchedules`
7. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getScheduleDetails?schedule=<scheduleId>`
8. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getAllEvents`
9. `GET /api/ScheduleGenerator/_getAllTasks`

## Frontend Status

The frontend is **100% correct** and ready to use. All API calls are properly formatted according to the specification. Once the backend implements the missing GET endpoints, the frontend will immediately work without any changes needed.

## Recommendation

**For Backend Developers:**
Implement the missing GET query endpoints in the backend. The POST endpoints are working perfectly - just need to add the corresponding GET endpoints to retrieve the saved data.

**For Testing:**
You can verify data is being saved by:
1. Creating schedules, events, and tasks through the frontend
2. Checking your database directly to confirm the data is there
3. Once GET endpoints are implemented, the frontend will display everything correctly

## Conclusion

✅ **Database IS being updated** - All POST operations work
✅ **Frontend IS correctly integrated** - All API calls are proper
❌ **Query endpoints missing** - Backend needs GET endpoint implementation
