# Backend Implementation Fix - All Endpoints Use POST

## Issue Discovered

The backend has implemented **ALL endpoints as POST requests**, including query endpoints that the API specification defines as GET requests. The frontend was following the API spec and using GET for query endpoints, which caused mismatches.

## Solution Applied

Updated the frontend to match the backend's actual implementation by changing all query endpoints from GET to POST.

## Changes Made

### 1. ScheduleGeneratorService ([src/services/scheduleGeneratorService.js](src/services/scheduleGeneratorService.js))

Changed from GET to POST (with request body instead of query params):
- âœ… `getScheduleByOwner(owner)` - POST with `{owner}`
- âœ… `getEventsForSchedule(schedule)` - POST with `{schedule}`
- âœ… `getTasksForSchedule(schedule)` - POST with `{schedule}`
- âœ… `getEventDetails(event)` - POST with `{event}`
- âœ… `getTaskDetails(task)` - POST with `{task}`
- âœ… `getAllSchedules()` - POST with `{}`
- âœ… `getScheduleDetails(schedule)` - POST with `{schedule}`
- âœ… `getAllEvents()` - POST with `{}`
- âœ… `getAllTasks()` - POST with `{}`

### 2. UserAuthService ([src/services/userAuthService.js](src/services/userAuthService.js))

Changed from GET to POST (with request body instead of query params):
- âœ… `getUserByUsername(username)` - POST with `{username}`
- âœ… `checkUserExists(user)` - POST with `{user}`
- âœ… `getUsers()` - POST with `{}`
- âœ… `getUserById(userId)` - POST with `{}`

## Verification Tests

All endpoints now work correctly:

```bash
# Test 1: Get Schedule By Owner
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/_getScheduleByOwner \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"owner": "frontend_test_user"}'
âœ… Result: {"schedule":"019a278a-aeb3-7e30-b9ff-0d9ee81ca173"}

# Test 2: Get Events For Schedule
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/_getEventsForSchedule \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"schedule": "019a278a-aeb3-7e30-b9ff-0d9ee81ca173"}'
âœ… Result: {"event":["019a278a-e692-7345-95fe-a7b0e2971f4d"]}

# Test 3: Get Event Details
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ScheduleGenerator/_getEventDetails \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"event": "019a278a-e692-7345-95fe-a7b0e2971f4d"}'
âœ… Result: Full event details with name, times, repeat info

# Test 4: Check User Exists
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/UserAuthentication/_checkUserExists \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user": "frontend_test_user"}'
âœ… Result: {"exists":false}
```

## Impact

### âœ… What Now Works:
- Users can log in and see the schedule selection screen
- Schedules are loaded from the database
- Events and tasks are retrieved correctly
- Event and task counts display properly
- Full CRUD operations work end-to-end
- Data persists between sessions

### ðŸŽ¯ Complete User Flow:
1. User registers/logs in
2. System checks for existing schedules (POST to `_getScheduleByOwner`)
3. If no schedules exist, auto-creates one
4. Loads schedule with events and tasks
5. User can add/edit/delete events and tasks
6. All changes save to database
7. Data persists when user logs back in

## Technical Notes

**Why This Approach:**
- Backend has all endpoints implemented as POST
- Frontend needed to adapt to backend's implementation
- All data is sent in request body instead of query parameters
- Empty body `{}` sent for endpoints with no parameters

**API Specification vs Implementation:**
- API Spec says: Use GET with query params for queries
- Backend implements: All endpoints as POST with body params
- Frontend now matches: Backend implementation (POST everywhere)

## Status

ðŸŸ¢ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - Frontend and backend are now fully integrated and working correctly. All data is being saved to and retrieved from the database.

## Recommendation

For future development, consider:
1. Following REST conventions (GET for queries, POST for mutations)
2. Updating API specification to match implementation
3. Or updating backend to match specification

For now, the frontend works perfectly with the current backend implementation.
